# <ins>Functions and Nested Loops

## Introduction
- In this project I explore the use of functions in C;
	- Declaring functions
	- Naming functions
	- Having a return type for the functions
	- Declaring formal parameters used in the functions if any

- I will also look at nested loops especially `for` and `while ` loops.
