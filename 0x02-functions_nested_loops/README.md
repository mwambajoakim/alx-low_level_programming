# <ins>Functions and Nested Loops

## Introduction
- In this project I explore the use of functions in C;
	- Declaring functions
	- Naming functions
	- Having a return type for the functions
	- Declaring formal parameters used in the functions if any

- I will also look at nested loops especially `for` and `while ` loops.

## 00 - _putchar
- This program prints _putchar and a new line.

## 01 - This function prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_alphabet(void);`
- `_putchar` was used twice in the code.

## 02 - fThis function prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- Prototype: `void print_alphabet_x10(void);`
- `_putchar` was used twice in the code.

## 03 - This function checks for lowercase character.
- Prototype: `int _islower(int c);`
- Returns `1` if `c` is lowercase.
- Returns `0` otherwise.
