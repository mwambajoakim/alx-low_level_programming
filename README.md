# <ins>Low Level Programming - C Language</ins>

## Introduction

C being a low level programming language is a start on this journey of coding and being a programmer. In this repository, I will cover a variety of topics in C from the basics until advanced. Eventually, my aim is to be able to write a whole shell using C. Hopefully in three months.

## 0x00-hello_world
This project mainly consisted of an introduction to writing C scripts inorder to perform basic operations in the shell.

## 0x01-variables_if_else_while
This project covers the conditionals in the C programming language. These include; `if`, `else if` and `else`. At the same time I also explore using the `while` loop in C.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops
This project explores the wild west of C ehich includes the use of functions and nested loops to make programs easy to write and debug.

## 0x03-debugging
This projects is about discovering errors in code manually commonly known as debugging. Of course it follows that the errors are called bugs.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops
This project was just an advancement of the previous project on loops.

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings
An introduction to pointers, arrays and strings. I used the concepts previously worked on such as loops and conditionals.

## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
A deeper dive into how pointers are used in C. Includes to arrays and strings and how they are used to access and manipulate data just like pointers.

## 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings
Continuous deep dive into pointers, more specifically double pointer and two-dimesnional arrays.

## 0x08-recursion
This project is about functions calling themselves inside the same function.

## 0x09-static_libraries
Project dives into the creation of static libraries locally and making object files. It also shows the creation of a script to automate this process.

## 0x0A-argc_argv
A deep dive into command line arguments that are supplied to a program through argc and argv.
