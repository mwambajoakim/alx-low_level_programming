# <ins>Variables, If, If...Else, While</ins>

## Introduction

In this project I explore the different aspects of C which mainly include conditionals. At the same time I get into using the ` while `  keyword used in C.

I will give a description of each question down below;

## 00 - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. 
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program.
-The output of the program should be:
	- The number `n`, followed by
		- if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
		- if the number is 0: `is zero`
		- if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
- followed by a new line

## 01 - This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. 
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program.
- The output of the program should be:
	- The string `Last digit of`, followed by
`n`, followed by
	- the string `is`, followed by
		- if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
		- if the last digit of n is 0: the string `and is 0`
		- if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
- followed by a new line

## 02 - This program will print the alphabet in lowercase
- I only used the `putchar` function and used it twice.
- All the code is in the `main` function.

## 03 - This program will print the alphabet in lowercase then uppercase
- All the code is written in the `main` function.
- I used `putchar` thrice to write to stdout.

## 04 - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase
- All the alphabets  will print except `e` and `q`.
- All the code is written in the `main` function
- I used the `putchar` function twice.

## 05 - This program prints all numbers of base 10 starting from `0`
- All the code is written in the `main` function.
- I used the `printf` function.

## 06 - This  program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`
- All the code is written in the `main` function.
- I used the `putchar` function twice.

## 07 - This program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by a new line

- All the code is written in the `main` function.
- I used the `putchar` function twice in the code.

## 08 - This program prints all numbers of base 16
- All the code is written in the `main` function.
- I used the `putchar` function thrice in the code.

## 09 - This program prints all possible single digit numbers

- The numbers are separated by a `,` followed by a space.
- Numbers are printed in ascending order.
- All the code is written in the `main` function
- I used the `putchar` function four times in the code.
