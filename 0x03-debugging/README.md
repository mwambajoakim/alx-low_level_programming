# <ins>Debugging</ins>

## Introduction
This is a simple project (not so simple) where I have projects that I need to find bugs manually. It helps to debug manually before using debugging technologies such as `gdb` and others.

## 00 - No Addition or Subtraction.
- Added the appropriate files.
- Replaced `98` with `0`.

## 01 - No Infinite Loop.
- Did not add or remove any line of code.
- Commented out the infinite loop as required.

## 02 - Print the largest of three integers.
- Arranged the variables in the conditionals appropriately.
- Added `greater than or equal` to signs to cover all cases.
