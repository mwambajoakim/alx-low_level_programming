# <ins>Low Level Programming - C Language</ins>

## Introduction

C being a low level programming language is a start on this journey of coding and being a programmer. In this repository, I will cover a variety of topics in C from the basics until advanced. Eventually, my aim is to be able to write a whole shell using C. Hopefully in three months.

## 0x00-hello_world
This project mainly consisted of an introduction to writing C scripts inorder to perform basic operations in the shell.

## 0x01-variables_if_else_while
This project covers the conditionals in the C programming language. These include; `if`, `else if` and `else`. At the same time I also explore using the `while` loop in C.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops
This project explores the wild west of C ehich includes the use of functions and nested loops to make programs easy to write and debug.

## 0x03-debugging
This projects is about discovering errors in code manually commonly known as debugging. Of course it follows that the errors are called bugs.
