# <ins>Pointers, Arrays and Strings</ins>

## Introduction
Here lies the deep waters of C. It is a journey I enjoy taking. In this project, I will be looking at pointers basics, arrays and strings which are character arrays.

## 00 - This function takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.
- Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`

## 01 -  This function swaps the values of two integers.
- Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`

## 02 - This function returns the length of a string.
- Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);`
